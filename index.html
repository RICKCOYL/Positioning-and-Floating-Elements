          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to understand why
          there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
          created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
          course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
          special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
          swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
          instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
          the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
          REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
          double box around it.<br />
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
          that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
          hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right. Reaching
          back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with
          telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M.
          Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
          ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves —
          the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was
          roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
          They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr.
          Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. Unlock more
          free articles. Create an account or log in Inflation has been the
          workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
          wondered whether it could ever be proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s
          work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
          discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big
          Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to
          science and speculation. Confirming inflation would mean that the
          universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
          hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
          larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
          Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
          other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta
          water boiling over.

      <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>

      <p>
        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
        operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
        on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
        would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
        according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
        space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an
        early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge,
        as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a signal from the very
        earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
        microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the
        universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
        sun. Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
        Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
        reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
        Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
        Astrophysical Journal.
